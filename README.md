# Howdy! 🤠

My name is Will Torres. I am pursuing an M.S. in Bioinformatics '24 at NYU and hold a B.S. in Computer Science '22 from Adelphi University.

I try to solve complex data tasks in computational biology/bioinformatics and _develop web applications_ for fun. Here is what I use:  
💻 Python, R, SQL, Java, C++.  
🧰 BioPython/Bioconductor, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy.  
☁️ Docker, Kubernetes, GCP (BigQuery, Datalab), AWS (S3, ECS, EC2, Lambda), Spark.  
🎨 _JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Django, Flask, REST APIs._

Fun Facts:  
🎼 I am a self-taught guitarist and percussionist.  
🎳 My best bowling game was 225.  
🥕 I grew a carrot once!
